Minecraft mod development framework used by Forge and FML for the gradle build system

## Latest gradle support

This version of ForgeGradle is individually modified by me, based on asbyth's updates.

The patch also includes the removal of the usages of deprecated classes/methods, which makes the project possibly compatible with gradle 8.0.
